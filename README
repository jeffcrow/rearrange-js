This script uses jQuery UI's sortable() function to make certain elements
on web pages re-arrangeable based on certain criteria.

The old version involves a server-side PHP script which downloads the page we want and inserts a <script> tag for our JS file. The page requested is currently hardcoded to NYTimes US News, but that can be changed in the PHP.

The new version, rearrange-bookmarklet.js, is a bookmarklet that runs entirely client-side.

Still a lot of bugs, especially related to dropping elements in new parts
of the page.

This script uses jQuery UI's sortable() function to make certain elements
on web pages re-arrangeable based on certain criteria.

Currently the script involves a server-side PHP script which downloads the
page we want and inserts a <script> tag for our JS file. Methods that don't
involve a server-side potion like a bookmarklet are being examined.

The page requested is currently hardcoded to NYTimes US News, but that can
be changed in the PHP.

Still a lot of bugs, especially related to dropping elements in new parts
of the page. Also the PHP proxy means that relative URLs break. Working on this.
